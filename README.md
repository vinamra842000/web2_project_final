Recipe Management System â€“ Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Recipe Management System is a web-based platform that allows users to browse, create, manage, and review recipes. It supports user registration and login, recipe creation/editing by registered users, and administrative control for managing users and recipes. The application is structured into public and private sections and includes role-based access (Admin/User). Users can view trending and latest recipes, search/filter them, leave comments, and rate recipes. Admins can monitor activities, manage content, and moderate users.

Team Responsibilities
Jolly is responsible for implementing the user authentication system, which includes the Login and Register pages. The registration page allows new users to sign up by entering their full name, email, and password. The login page supports authentication using email and password and includes an option to log in as a guest. Jolly also manages the comment and review system, enabling logged-in users to leave feedback and rate recipes. This feature enhances user engagement by allowing users to interact with each recipe via comments and star ratings, and also includes support for editing or deleting personal reviews.

Dhruv handles the public-facing pages of the application. This includes the Home Page, which displays recipe photo cards categorized as trending or recently added. Dhruv also implements the Recipe Detail Page, which presents the full content of an individual recipe, including its photo, ingredients, preparation steps, cook time, and user reviews. Additionally, Dhruv is responsible for the Search and Filter page, allowing users to find recipes based on keywords, ingredients, tags, or categories, improving the discoverability of content across the platform.

Hiren is in charge of the recipe management interface for registered users. Hiren designs and develops the My Recipes page where users can view a list of their submitted recipes with options to edit or delete them. The Create Recipe page allows users to input recipe details such as title, image, ingredients, and preparation steps, and save the recipe to their profile. The Edit Recipe page enables users to update their existing recipes. These features ensure users have full control over their content while maintaining data validation and security.

Vinamra is responsible for the admin functionalities of the platform. This includes the Admin Dashboard, which provides an overview of platform metrics such as total users, total recipes, and recent activity. Vinamra also implements the User Management Page, where administrators can view all registered users, update or delete user accounts, and manage user roles (e.g., promote to admin). Lastly, Vinamra manages the Recipe Moderation Page, which allows the admin to view, filter, and delete any recipe in the system, ensuring quality control and content moderation.
